# A Vegetarian's Culinary Experiments

## About me

👋 Hi! My name is [@wild-wind](https://www.instagram.com/wild.wind.557/) and I'm not a chef. I do not intend to be one.

🥗 Food is obviously a necessity.

🧑‍🔬 I work in IT during the day, and I love science.

🐾 I am a strict practitioner of non-cruelty towards animals and want to do my part in keeping the environment safe.

Experimenting with vegetarian and vegan cooking is something I enjoy. Being a minimalist, I tend not to follow recipes word to word but get creative with what I have at hand. I hope my experiments inspire you. Feel free to add your comments if you believe I could do something better. I'm still learning. 🙂

> **Difficulty**: Medium |
> **Prep Time**: 1.5 days |
> **Cook Time**: 20 mins |
> **Yield**: 3 servings

## Ingredients
- 1 cup Ragi seeds
- 2/3 cup Urad/Udid dal/Black gram
- 1 cup Whole Wheat
- 1 teaspoon Fenugreek/Methi seeds
- Salt [optional]

## Procedure

### Preparing the batter
- **Soak** the ragi seeds for 8-12 hours, and then remove the soaking water and let them **sprout** for 12-24 hours.
- **Soak** the urad dal with fenugreek seeds for 8-12 hours.
- **Blend** the urad-fenugreek mixture to a smooth batter along with the sprouted ragi. Add water if required.
- In a mixing bowl, sift the flour and slowly mix it into the batter. Add water if the batter gets too thick.
- If the environment is warm, add a 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of salt and let the batter rest for **fermentation** for about 8 hours till it rises to twice its size. If the environment is cold, skip the salt and let the batter ferment for about 12 hours. Ensure that the batter does not turn too sour.
- Once the batter has risen, keep it in the refrigerator. The batter stays good for 3-5 days.

### Making idli
- **Grease** a stainless steel or glass deep plate, bowl or glass and pour the batter into it.
- **Steam** it for 10-15 minutes till a knife or toothpick poked into it comes out clean.
- Let it cool and then run a knife along the edges to **unmold** the idli onto a plate.
